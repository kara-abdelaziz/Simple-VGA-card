# Simple-VGA-card
This project involves a replicate implementation of the World Worst Video Card, the educational vga video card designed by Ben Eater in his [website](https://eater.net/) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/beneater) channel. A simple educational digital logic simulation called [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) was used to implement the Simple VGA Card. Actually two identical implementations are deposit in this repository, one constructed from the ground using only logic gates and single memory cells (flipflops) placed in the file [SimpleVGACard.circ](https://github.com/kara-abdelaziz/Simple-VGA-card/blob/main/SimpleVGACard.circ), and the second using only TTL [74xx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_7400-series_integrated_circuits) chips serie, it is placed in the file [SimpleVGACard-TTL.circ](https://github.com/kara-abdelaziz/Simple-VGA-card/blob/main/SimpleVGACard-TTL.circ). The schematis of the two circuits are depicted just below.
